# Music-Recommendation-System-using-Python

## About The Project

The Spotify Recommender Project is a Python-based recommendation system that provides song recommendations to users based on their input song preference. This project utilizes the Spotify API, machine learning, and collaborative filtering techniques to deliver personalized music recommendations.

### Built With

1. Python
2. [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
3. [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/)

## Overview

The Spotify Recommender Project:

1. Providing song recommendations based on their input song choice.
2. Incorporating user preferences and music features for more accurate recommendations.
3. Combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to offer diverse and personalized song suggestions.

## Getting Started

1. Sign up for a Spotify Developer account and obtain API credentials.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries, including `spotipy`, `pandas`, and more.
3. Replace 'your_client_id' and 'your_client_secret' in the code with your Spotify API credentials.
   
### Prerequisites

1. Spotify Developer Account:
   - Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
   - Create a Spotify application and note your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.

## Implementation

Key steps:

1. **Authentication**: We obtain an access token from the Spotify API for making requests.

2. **Data Collection**: We retrieve song data and audio features for a wide range of tracks from the Spotify API.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: We clean and prepare the data for the recommendation system.

4. **Collaborative Filtering**: We use collaborative filtering techniques to identify similar users and recommend songs liked by users with similar taste.

5. **Content-Based Filtering**: We incorporate audio features to recommend songs with similar musical characteristics.

6. **Hybrid Recommendations**: We provide a hybrid approach that combines collaborative and content-based filtering for diverse and personalized recommendations.

## Results

The Spotify Recommender Project offers users a seamless music discovery experience. By combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, it provides personalized recommendations that consider both user preferences and music features.
